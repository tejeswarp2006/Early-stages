# Early stages

This is the first project we'll be doing in **`C language`**.

So this project is about the reflex or response time you have. 
The faster you react the more is your reflex. 

In the modern days people are just scrolling through reels and brainrotting. This is a program for people to test their reflex time.

## Plan

Learn some new things.

The project will be having two phases.
1) **Visual reflex** : 
- As we press a key, after some random time (few seconds) there will appear a message, as soon as we see this we have to press a key.
- The program will calculate the time taken by the user to press the key after the message is displayed.

2) **I donno what is the reflex for hearing** :
- As we press a key, after some random time (few seconds) there will appear a beep sound, as soon as we hear this we have to press a key.
- The program will calculate the time taken by the user to press the key after the the beep is given.

Will be using **C Language** for the project.
The extension of the files will be ``.c``

Compilation will be done using **GCC**
