# Give_Up

1) I don't know the reason why people are afraid to learn new things.
2) Never think the other guy knows everything...He may be a big loser than you...
3) Think about the situation we aren't able to finish a `50` line code in `3-4` days what do you expect from yourself in `2` years.
4) Even I don't know `C` language.

I just give up...
